## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Launcher in a commercial environment?

**Yes!** GPL allows commercial use. You can use Launcher in a business environment, even to make money. However, if you distribute it (modified or not), you must provide the source code under GPL.

### Can I modify Launcher and keep changes private?

**Yes**, if you don't distribute the modified version. GPL's requirements only apply when you distribute the software. Private modifications for personal use don't need to be shared.

### Can I sell Launcher?

**Yes**, you can sell copies of Launcher. However, you must:
1. Provide the source code
2. License it under GPL-3.0-or-later
3. Allow buyers to redistribute freely

Most people distribute GPL software for free, but charging for distribution is allowed.

### Can I use Launcher code in my proprietary software?

**No**, not directly. GPL is a copyleft license that requires derivative works to also be GPL-licensed. If you incorporate GPL code into your software, your entire program must be GPL-licensed.

**Alternative**: You could:
- Use Launcher as a separate tool (not incorporated into your code)
- Contact the maintainer for a different licensing arrangement
- Rewrite the functionality independently

### What if I only modify Launcher for internal use?

If you modify Launcher but only use it internally within your organization (not distributing it), you don't need to share your changes. GPL requirements apply to distribution, not use.

### Do I need permission to fork Launcher?

**No**, GPL explicitly grants you the right to create forks. You're encouraged to fork and improve the project! Just remember to:
1. Keep the GPL license
2. Provide source code if you distribute
3. Credit original authors

### Can I relicense Launcher?

**No**, only the copyright holder can change the license. If you're not the copyright holder, you must keep the GPL license for any distributions or derivatives.

### What about plugins/extensions?

Extensions that are separate programs and communicate with Launcher only through defined APIs might not need to be GPL-licensed (this is debated). However, extensions that are loaded into Launcher's process space are likely considered derivative works and should be GPL-licensed.

When in doubt, use GPL for safety or consult a legal professional.
